#### Challenge Overview

Describe the many measures of centrality of at least one network of your choice.

##### Describe the Network Data

If you have not done it before, always start by evaluating the basic structure of the network (number of edges and vertices, dyad and triad census, etc.). Create a data frame \`nodes\` with the corresponding local attributes such as degree or local transitivity.

##### Centrality

Compute at least one measure of centrality for each node, adding them as attributes to \`nodes\` in the form of extra columns: eigencentrality, betweenness, closeness, etc. Compute the distribution of at least one of those measures. What do we learn from comparing these measures of centrality with an equivalent random network (i.e. with the same number of edges and vertices)?

```{r}
library(readr)
got_distances <- read_csv("posts/_data/got/got_distances.csv")
head(got_distances)
```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Load the required package
library(igraph)
# Create the network from the dataset
net <- graph.data.frame(got_distances, directed = FALSE)
# Basic structure of the network
edges <- ecount(net)
vertices <- vcount(net)
# Dyad and triad census
dyads <- dyad_census(net)
triads <- triad_census(net)
# Create the nodes data frame with local attributes
nodes <- data.frame(
  vertex = V(net)$name,  # Assuming the vertices have a 'name' attribute
  degree = degree(net),
  transitivity = transitivity(net, type = "local")
)
```

```{r}
# Print the basic network structure
cat("Number of edges:", edges, "\n")
cat("Number of vertices:", vertices, "\n")
print(dyads)
print(triads)
# Print the nodes data frame
print(nodes)
```

```{r}
in_net <- centr_degree(net, loops = FALSE, mode = "in")
in_net
out_net <- centr_degree(net, loops = FALSE, mode = "out")
out_net
net_total <- centr_degree(net, loops = FALSE, mode = "total")
net_total
```

```{r}
eigen <- eigen_centrality(net)$vector
betweeness <- igraph::betweenness(net, directed = F)
close <- igraph::closeness(net, mode = "out")
```

```{r}
# Compute the distribution of one centrality measure (e.g., eigencentrality)
eigen_dist <- table(nodes$eigen)
# Print the distribution of eigencentrality
print(eigen_dist)
```
