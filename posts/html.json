Identify an existing data set or collect your own data. Provide a thorough description of the network data and the protocols used to collect and code it. The information provided should be sufficient to allow someone to recreate your network data from the original source. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst we will invoke the ipumsr library to read in the data. The read_ipums_micro() function takes two arguments: the DDI file and the data file. The DDI file is an XML file that contains metadata about the data. The data file is a gzipped file that contains the data itself. Both files are located in the posts/ directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ipumsr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'ipumsr' was built under R version 4.1.3\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nddi <- read_ipums_ddi(\"cps_00003.xml\")\ncps_data <- read_ipums_micro(ddi, data_file = \"cps_00003.dat\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nUse of data from IPUMS CPS is subject to conditions including that users should\ncite the data appropriately.

Was the original data in matrix, edgelist or affiliation network format?\n\n\nThe data that I will be using is Data from  Current Population Survey provided by Integrated Public Use Microdata Series(IPUMS) which was created by University Of Minessota.\n\nThe Current Population Survey originally comes from the Bureau of Labor,and IPUMS is a data aggregator that harmonized the CPS  Data creating consistent variables across years to facilitate longitudinal analysis.\n\n\nb.Is this network a sample or does it represent the universe of cases? If a sample, is the sample adequate/random/suitable?\n\nThe Data is  a sample collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The sample is adequate and suitable because it is a random sample of the population.\n\nAlso, the CPS dataset is designed to answer questions regarding Labor Force Demographics.\n\n\nc. What constitutes a vertex/node in these data? What is the level of analysis (person, organization, etc.)? How many nodes are in the data set?\n\nThe level are analaysis are people. Each node represents a person responding to the survey. The edges represent a connection of industry to their self reported race, gender or country of origin in the Census.\n\n\n\nIn terms of the the numbers of nodes, it varies  by each graph.\n\ng_race\nNumber of Nodes: 567 \nNumber of Edges: 2058407 \nDiameter: 3 \ng_country\nNumber of Nodes: 296 \nNumber of Edges: 1548 \nDiameter: 7 \ng_sex\nNumber of Nodes: 541 \nNumber of Edges: 2058407 \nDiameter: 4 \n\n\n\nd.What constitutes a tie in these data? Is the tie weighted or unweighted? If weighted, what is the range of tie values? What is the tie measuring, and is the measure adequate?\n\nThe Tie that this Data is measuring is the tie between the Industry a Person is in and the Demographic variables that a person has such as Race, Coutnry of Origin and  Gender.\n\n\n\ne.\nWere any transformations used (e.g., thresholds, one-mode projection) to create final network data used in analysis?\n\nThere were no transformations suhc as thresholds or one-mode projection used to create the final network data used in analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##Answers to Question 2\n\n2.\n\nProvide additional descriptive statistics about your network data. The information provided should be sufficient to allow someone to understand the distinctive features of your network data. Please include a substantive discussion or interpretation of the meaning of each of these features – this is not merely a statistical report.
