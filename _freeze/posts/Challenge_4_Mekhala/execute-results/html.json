Create a data frame `nodes` with the corresponding local attributes such as degree or local transitivity.\n\n## Centrality\n\nCompute at least one measure of centrality for each node, adding them as attributes to `nodes` in the form of extra columns: eigencentrality, betweenness, closeness, etc. Compute the distribution of at least one of those measures. What do we learn from comparing these measures of centrality with an equivalent random network (i.e. with the same number of edges and vertices)?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::",
