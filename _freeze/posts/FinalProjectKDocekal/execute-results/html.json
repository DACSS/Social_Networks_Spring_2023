Results indicate that there is a significant positive effect where support for welfare spending increases as network size increases.\n\n### Research Question\n\nHow does interpersonal group network structure affect support for welfare spending?\n\nThis study uses social network data from the 2004 General Social Survey (GSS) to examine group network structure and investigate possible relationships with support for welfare state expansion as measured by increased spending. Close social networks are strong determinants of an individuals views and opinions and may influence their perspectives on public policy. This can be due to the influence of specific actors that make up those networks or due to the structure of the network themselves. This study focuses on the role network characteristics, such as size and strength, pay in influencing an individual's response to whether government should spend more on social support programs.\n\nWhile networks groups may form for different reasons, including as a way of gaining useful policy information (Carpenter,2003), once formed one can imagine potential influences of close social groups working in multiple ways. A population with a preponderance of tight, family based social networks compared to one with more networks with fewer nodes and looser relationships may either place less value on state social services, being redundant to the ego network's own role, or may have the opposite effect. The parallels between state and social network roles may instead help foster greater understanding and value of state welfare programs. Network impact may also be a function of norm enforcing behavior as previously suggested (Pisorski, 2017) where dense networks lead to more frequent punishment and fewer norm violations.\n\nInvestigation into this topic can be helpful in broadening understanding about how social network structures and characteristics may shape a certain population's views and interactions with government welfare policy. This study builds on previous research into the role of networks on public policy such as Fernandez and Gould's 1994 showing the importance of brokerage positions in communication networks in health policy. Similar to Rolfe's 2012 \"Education and High-Salience Elections,\" where the author draws on 1985 GSS data to study how education impacts voting behavior, this study utilizes the 2004 GSS data set which provides data points needed for an ego network as well as important corresponding variables.\n\nThe unique measures provided by the 2004 GSS dataset also enables this study to utilize interaction data, similar to Schein et al.'s use in the case of country to country analysis, but at the interpersonal level. Interaction can be represented in two ways; using the 'close' variable based on overall respondent perception of closeness, and the \"talkto\" variable which captures interaction based on interpersonal conversation frequency. As previously highlighted (Heider, 1946), interpersonal attitudes are strong influences of unit formation. These variables, in addition to impacting overall respondent alter selection, as measured by the variable numgiven, capture both the degree and strength formed network units.\n\nThe influence of the ego node, the respondent, and of the other alter nodes, is another focal point of the analysis. By looking at \"which actors are perceived as influential, and how influence is structured, similar to Lewis 2006's work on health policy, this study provides a similar investigation into circumstances behind how powerful actors shape responses to state policy. Looking at measures such as ethnic diversity may also be highly relevant as greater diversity has been found to correlate with more negative attitudes towards the welfare state (Stichnoth & Van der Straeten 2013) while other studies (Wlezien & Soroka, 2021) have indicated that individual-level factors in demographics matter little to the temporal variation of welfare preferences.With ego network density we can see how network strength and density may affected respondents which may,for example, receive less welfare benefits compared to less-wealthy peers.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nGreater personal network size is positively correlated to increased support for government welfare spending.\n\nNetworks with stronger ties are correlated with decreased support for government spending.\n\nIn Rolfe's 2012 study people embedded in larger social network contexts were more likely to vote compare to those with smaller networks. This hypothesis tests a similar relationship towards government welfare spending support. This could be due to factors such as where having a large network increases the respondent's probability of having a contact that would benefit from increased state support. This personal connect may be what motivates an otherwise disinterested respondent to support increased spending.The nature of social relationships described by GSS respondents may given insight into those respondents corresponding policy preferences. This may be as a factor their ego network size, such as the number of contact nodes connected to, or more as a result of the strength of those ties such as measured by edge weight in terms of respondent indicated familiarity score.The networks' characteristics themselves may reveal insights about the populations support for welfare policies. We can look at factors such as network homogeneity by variables such as race, education, and relationship type.\n\n## Description\n\n### Data set\n\nThis data set is drawn from the General Social Survey (GSS) which is a nationally representative survey of adults in the United States conducted since 1972. The vast majority of GSS data is obtained in face-to-face interviews although some interviews are also conducted with computer-assisted interviewing and through phone interviews. The GSS contains a standard core of demographic, behavioral, and attitudinal questions including questions covering civil liberties, national spending priorities, psychological well-being, social mobility, and traumatic events. The 2004 GSS additionally contains measures of personal social networks including personal characteristics of friends and respondents' contacts and measures of relationship strength. Survey participants provided a list of up to six people with whom they \"discussed important matters,\" and then provide additional information about each of those contacts.The original full data set is in edge list format and consists of 1261 columns and 2812 rows.\n\nOnce transformed into a matrix network format, the data consists of nodes based on survey respondents and their stated personal contact allowing for person level analysis. Here we have 5 nodes. Ties are based on scores from the variables \"close\" which measure respondents' perceptions of the closeness of their reported contacts, to the respondent and to each other. Scores are on a three point scale from especially close, to know each other, to total strangers. This enables the ties in our network to be accordingly weighted.Each network consists of multiple separate ego networks centered around each GSS respondent and their stated contacts. Within each ego network the number and strength of ties between nodes varies. With this network data the respondents become ego nodes and their listed contacts are alters.\n\nIVs\n\nnumgiven - This a measure of ego-centered or Core Network Size (Wasserman and Faust 1994 ), a count from 0 to 5 of the number of contacts provided by each respective survey respondent.\n\nContact-alter related variables:\n\nSpouse1, spouse2, spouse3 (to 5); parent1, sibling1, child1, othfam1, cowork1, memgrp1, neighbr1, friend1, advisor1, other1 - These measures denote the type of relationship per contact by respondent provided contact number. For example, spouse1 indicates that the first contact provided by that respondent is a spouse. All variables, and those similarly formatted below, range from 1 to 5 corresponding to the respective contact's number as provided by the respondent.\n\nclose12, close13, close14, close15, close23, close24, close25, close34, close35, close45 - This variable is the respondent provided weight measure of the indicated relationship. For example, close12 provides a measure of the closeness of the relationship between respondent provided contacts 1 and 2.\n\ntalkto1 how often does r talk to person #1? - This measure represents the respondent's estimate of the strength of each possible dyadic tie between the respondent and indicated contact.\n\neduc1 - Respondent provided contact education level, capturing 1 to graduate levels, on a 7 point scale.\n\nage1 - Contact age.\n\nrelig1 - Contact religion with options of Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, none, or other.\n\nsex1 - Contact gender, either male - 1, or female - 2.\n\nrace1 - Contact race in terms of Asian, Black, Hispanic, White, or Other.\n\nyrskwn1 - Years the respondent as known that contact.\n\nRespondent-ego variables:\n\nincome - Respondent's total family income.\n\nage - Age of respondent.\n\nregion - Region of interview.\n\nsex - Respondent's sex.\n\ndegree - Respondent's education level in terms of highest degree.\n\nrace - Respondent's race.\n\nrelig - Respondent's religious preference.\n\nprestg10 - Respondent's occupational prestige score based on the 2010 Census occupation classification. This standard prestige score is a simple mean value of ratings for each occupation category, converted to a scale of 0 (bottom) to 100 (top).\n\nattend - How often the respondent attends religious services.\n\npartyid - Respondent's political party affiliation.\n\nDV\n\nnatfare - A 3 point scale of respondent's perspective on government welfare spending\n\n### Set up\n\nThe full 2004 GSS data set can be accessed directly in R from the kjhealy github page.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nremotes::install_github(\"kjhealy/gssr\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nSkipping install of 'gssr' from a github remote, the SHA1 (abe949b1) has not changed since last install.\n  Use `force = TRUE` to force installation\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndrat::addRepo(\"kjhealy\")\n\ngss04 <- gss_get_yr(2004)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nFetching: https://gss.norc.org/documents/stata/2004_stata.zip\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis full data set contains 2812 rows of observations with 1 observation per survey respondent.

This result has low predictive power. With the ego network tested we also found a clique network where all nodes are mutually connected and able to influence the respondent's policy decision making. Due to the nature of the survey however, which consists of multiple individual ego networks, this applies to only the example random network used. The nature of other ego networks vary which most respondents reporting no or only 1 contact. This preponderance in small ego network size is especially significant. As mean network size has decreased by about a third, from 2.94 in 1985 to 2.08 in 2004, (McPherson et al., 2006) this means that individual are being less influenced by inter-personal contacts compared to other forms of political and policy influence.\n\nWhile this analysis was helpful in identifying the nature and significance of ego nodes we are missing some insights into directionality. As previously noted, (Lazer et al., 2010) individuals shift their political views toward the political views of their associates. We are missing information that may better indicate the actual levels and directionality of influence of specific nodes. Each ego network, especially in terms of upper limit, is also a constrained model and limited by the options imposed on respondents due to the nature of the survey. This makes the results not truly representative of the range of connections possible to individuals to reality although, since many networks are small and fall under this threshold, any effect may be limited. Additionally, as measures on important alter variables, such as contact gender, age, and relationship link strength, derive solely from the respondent the are vulnerable to biases in respondent perception. This may skew results and would require a more extensive study to determine the extent of any discrepencies.\n\n## Bibliography\n\nBrandes, U., Kenis, P., & Wagner, D. (2003).
