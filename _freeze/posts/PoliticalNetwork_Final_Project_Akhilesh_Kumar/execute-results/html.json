The main objective was to examine the trade relationships and dynamics between Ukraine and its trading partners during this specific time period. To achieve this, I created a trade network matrix consisting of 209 countries that have trade relations with countries trading with Ukraine, allowing us to observe changes in international trade.\n\nThe International Trade Data I acquired, specifically focusing on the trade of Wheat under the Harmonized System Code (HSCode) 1001, required a laborious and time-consuming data extraction process from a designated website. To ensure a comprehensive analysis, I performed numerous iterations and queries to gather country-specific import and export data for the selected HS Code. With over 250 countries in the dataset, extracting data separately for imports and exports necessitated running the download process over 500 times.\n\nWhile I also collected trade data for Natural Gas (HS-Code: 2709) and Crude Oil (HS-Code: 2711), due to time constraints, my current analysis is solely dedicated to the trade of Wheat.\n\nThe trade data includes all the countries that engaged in wheat import and export activities with the countries trading with Ukraine between 2015 and 2022. This comprehensive dataset enables an in-depth analysis of the trade changes resulting from the ongoing conflict. By examining the trade relationships within this context, we can gain valuable insights into the impact of the war on international trade dynamics.\n\nThe analysis focuses on assessing the repercussions of the conflict on the Wheat supply chain, including fluctuations in export volumes, changes in trade patterns, and the potential influence on global wheat prices. By shedding light on these dynamics, the aim is to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the broader implications of the Ukraine and Russia war on the global Wheat market. Additionally, the analysis will identify potential challenges and opportunities that may arise as a result of the conflict.\n\nThrough meticulous examination of the data, the objective is to extract valuable insights and conduct a comprehensive analysis of various aspects related to the trade of Wheat. This includes exploring patterns, identifying trends, and investigating country-specific information pertaining to Wheat imports and exports. The aim is to uncover significant findings that will allow for meaningful conclusions and contribute to our understanding of the global Wheat market and its dynamic nature.\n\nThe findings contribute to a deeper understanding of Ukraine's international trade and provide valuable information for policymakers, economists, and businesses interested in the country's trade dynamics. The analysis emphasizes the importance of considering specific country relationships and time periods when studying trade flows, as it allows for a more targeted and insightful analysis.\n\nFurthermore, there is a particular interest in assessing the impact of the supply chain disruption caused by the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia. Notably, as of the 2022/2023 marketing year, Ukraine ranked as the fifth-largest exporter of wheat worldwide, with total exports surpassing 13.5 million metric tons, accounting for approximately nine percent of the global wheat trade share. Delving deeper into the trade data will evaluate the repercussions of the conflict on the Wheat supply chain, examining fluctuations in export volumes, changes in trade patterns, and the potential influence on global wheat prices. The objective is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the broader implications of the Ukraine and Russia war on the global Wheat market while identifying potential challenges and opportunities that may arise as a result.\n\nThe objective is to conduct an in-depth analysis of the trade data to evaluate the specific changes and impacts on trade patterns and volumes resulting from the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia. This analysis will contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the trade dynamics within the global Wheat market during this turbulent period.\n\n# Hypothesis\n\nThe ongoing Ukraine and Russia conflict has likely disrupted the global wheat supply chain, leading to changes in trade patterns, fluctuations in export volumes, and potential influences on wheat prices.\n\n# Load Data, and Identify Trading Countries\n\nDetermine the countries that are directly involved in wheat trade with Ukraine (importing from Ukraine). These countries are likely to have been most affected by the conflict. \n\nIdentify high, normal, low trade countries primarily based on quantile distribution of consolidated and yearly trade volume\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n# List of years\nyears <- 2015:2022\n\n# Empty list to store countries where Ukraine exported goods\nexport_countries <- list()\n\n#

average path length, giant component proportion, singleton proportion, vertex attribute names, edge attribute names, max and min edge weights, median edge weight, and edge density. These calculations provide a comprehensive overview of the network's structure, connectivity, and characteristics for each year.

It provides an indication of the maximum number of steps or connections required to reach one node from another.This significant increase suggests a substantial expansion in the distance between nodes or entities within the network. It indicates a higher number of intermediary countries or entities involved in the trade routes, potentially reflecting changes in trade patterns or disruptions in supply chains.\n\nIt implies that the trade relationships or interactions between countries in the network have become more indirect or distant in 2022 compared to the previous years. It could indicate a higher number of intermediary countries or entities involved in the trade routes between specific pairs of countries.\n\n**Average Path Length** has increased to 6057.5 in 2022, compared to 4136.258 in 2021 and 1903.8 in 2020. This upward trend suggests that, on average, it requires more steps or connections to reach one country from another within the network. The increase in average path length indicates a greater degree of indirectness or longer trade routes between countries. It could be influenced by changes in trade patterns, the addition of new countries, or shifts in trade relationships.\n\n**Giant Component Proportion** has come down from 0.93 in 2021 to 0.89 in 2022. This metric represents the proportion of nodes that belong to the largest connected component in the network.The decrease in the Giant Component Proportion suggests a reduction in the relative size or dominance of the largest connected component compared to the overall network. It indicates a potential fragmentation or dispersal of trade relationships within the network.\n\n**Proportion of Singltons** have gone up from 0.071 to 0.11, The increase in the Proportion of Singletons suggests a higher percentage of nodes that are not engaged in direct trade relationships with other nodes in the network. It indicates a rise in the number of isolated entities or countries within the trade network.This change could be influenced by various factors such as changes in trade policies, shifts in market demand, disruptions in supply chains.\n\n**Edge Density** has decreased from 0.43 in 2021 to 0.34 in 2022. Edge Density is a measure of how many potential edges exist in the network compared to the actual number of edges present.The decrease in Edge Density suggests a reduction in the overall connectivity or density of trade relationships in the network. It indicates that a smaller proportion of potential trade relationships are realized or present in the network.The decline in Edge Density could be influenced by various factors such as changes in trade patterns, disruptions in supply chains, or shifts in trade relationships.\n\n**Number of Components** is consistently one in all years, it indicates that every node in the network is directly or indirectly connected to every other node.\n\n**Median Edge Weight** has sudden increase to 1224.5 in 2022 compared to 743 in 2020, 1025 in 2021. The higher edge weight values indicate a stronger higher number trades between countries in terms of the traded commodity wheat, which suggests changes in trade patterns, disruptions in supply chains, and shifts in trade relationships. It highlights the impact of geopolitical events on network dynamics and the potential influence on trade networks.\n\n**Minimum Edge Weight** is consistently 1, the minimum edge weight being one indicates that there is a minimum level of trade or interaction between any pair of entities in the network.\n\n## Geodesic Distance Distribution\n\nGeodesic distance plays a significant role in analyzing the impact of the Ukraine-Russia war on wheat international trade. This information helps assess the potential disruptions and logistical challenges faced in the wheat supply chain due to the war and enables better understanding of the spatial dynamics of the conflict's effects on trade.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# List of networks (assuming you have the networks for each year)\nnetworks <- list(network_2015, network_2016, network_2017, network_2018, network_2019, network_2020, network_2021, network_2022)\n\n# Create an empty list to store geodesic distances year-wise\ngeodesic_list <- list()\n# Create an empty list to store frequency tables year-wise\nfreq_table_list <- list()\n\n# Create empty vectors to store summary statistics\nmean_list <- vector()\nmin_list <- vector()\nmax_list <- vector()\nmedian_list <- vector()\n\n# Loop over the networks\nfor (i in seq_along(networks)) {\n  network <- networks[[i]]\n  year <- 2015 + i -

The year 2022 stands out with notable changes compared to previous years, indicating a significant impact on the supply chain network and potential disruptions.\n\nFirstly, the geodesic distance mean, maximum, and median all exhibit substantial increases in 2022. This suggests that the network's nodes are becoming more geographically distant from each other on average, with longer routes and potentially heightened isolation between them. These changes imply that supply chain flows may encounter greater challenges, such as longer lead times, increased transportation costs, and potential disruptions in the flow of goods.\n\n## Diad and Triad Analysis\n\nDiad and triad analysis for wheat international trade in the context of the Ukraine-Russia war focuses on studying the trade relationships between pairs and groups of three high trade countries. By examining diads and triads involved in wheat trade, it offers insights into supply chain disruptions, and potential shifts. This analysis contributes to understanding the changing landscape of wheat trade amidst the ongoing conflict and its implications for the industry.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# List of networks\nnetworks <- list(network_2015, network_2016, network_2017, network_2018, network_2019, network_2020, network_2021, network_2022)\n\n# Create empty lists to store the results\ndyads_list <- list()\ntriads_list <- list()\n\n# Perform dyad and triad analysis for each network\nfor (i in 1:length(networks)) {\n  network <- networks[[i]]\n\n  # Subset the network to only include nodes in the list of high trade intensity countries for this year\n  high_trade_network <- induced_subgraph(network, which(V(network)$name %in% high_intensity_countries_year[[as.character(2015+i-1)]]))\n\n  # Classify all Dyads in the high trade intensity network\n  dyads <- dyad_census(high_trade_network)\n  dyads_list[[i]] <- dyads\n  \n  # Classify all Triads in the high trade intensity network\n  triads <- triad_census(high_trade_network)\n  triads_list[[i]] <- triads\n}\n\n# Print the results as before\n# Define the triad labels\ntriad_labels <- c(\"003\", \"012\", \"102\", \"021D\", \"021U\", \"021C\", \"111D\", \"111U\", \"030T\", \"030C\", \"201\", \"120D\", \"120U\", \"120C\", \"210\", \"300\")\n\n# Print the results\nfor (i in 5:length(networks)) {\n  year <- 2015 + (i - 1)\n  cat(\"Year\", year, \":\\n\")\n  \n  cat(\"Dyad Analysis:\\n\")\n  dyads <- dyads_list[[i]]\n  cat(\"Mutually connected dyads: \", dyads[[\"mut\"]], \"\\n\")\n  cat(\"One-way connected dyads: \", dyads[[\"asym\"]], \"\\n\")\n  cat(\"Disconnected dyads: \", dyads[[\"null\"]], \"\\n\")\n  cat(\"Triad Analysis:\\n\")\n  triads <- triads_list[[i]]\n  for (j in 1:length(triad_labels)) {\n    cat(triad_labels[j], \"Triads: \", triads[j], \"\\n\")\n  }\n  cat(\"\\n\")\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nYear 2019 :\nDyad Analysis:\nMutually connected dyads:  4 \nOne-way connected dyads:  15 \nDisconnected dyads:  152 \nTriad Analysis:\n003 Triads:  698 \n012 Triads:  179 \n102 Triads:  43 \n021D Triads:  10 \n021U Triads:  2 \n021C Triads:  15 \n111D Triads:  5 \n111U Triads:  13 \n030T Triads:  0 \n030C Triads:  0 \n201 Triads:  1 \n120D Triads:  1 \n120U Triads:  0 \n120C Triads:  0 \n210 Triads:  2 \n300 Triads:  0 \n\nYear 2020 :\nDyad Analysis:\nMutually connected dyads:  3 \nOne-way connected dyads:  15 \nDisconnected dyads:  118 \nTriad Analysis:\n003 Triads:  458 \n012 Triads:  152 \n102 Triads:  25 \n021D Triads:  17 \n021U Triads:  3 \n021C Triads:  6 \n111D Triads:  0 \n111U Triads:  15 \n030T Triads:  1 \n030C Triads:  0 \n201 Triads:  1 \n120D Triads:  0 \n120U Triads:  1 \n120C Triads:  0 \n210 Triads:  1 \n300 Triads:  0 \n\nYear 2021 :\nDyad Analysis:\nMutually connected dyads:  2 \nOne-way connected dyads:  16 \nDisconnected dyads:  153 \nTriad Analysis:\n003 Triads:  717 \n012 Triads:  180 \n102 Triads:  22 \n021D Triads:  28 \n021U Triads:  3 \n021C Triads:  3 \n111D Triads:  2 \n111U Triads:  10 \n030T Triads:  4 \n030C Triads:  0 \n201 Triads:  0 \n120D Triads:  0 \n120U Triads:  0 \n120C Triads:  0 \n210 Triads:  0 \n300 Triads:  0 \n\nYear 2022 :\nDyad Analysis:\nMutually connected dyads:  16 \nOne-way connected dyads:  4 \nDisconnected dyads:  16 \nTriad Analysis:\n003 Triads:  10 \n012 Triads:  7 \n102 Triads:  27 \n021D Triads:  0 \n021U Triads:  0 \n021C Triads:  1 \n111D Triads:  1 \n111U Triads:  7 \n030T Triads:  0 \n030C Triads:  0 \n201 Triads:  5 \n120D Triads:  0 \n120U Triads:  0 \n120C Triads:  0 \n210 Triads:  11 \n300 Triads:  15 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom a dyad perspective, we can see a significant increase in the number of mutually connected dyads from 3 in 2020 to 16 in 2022. This suggests that more countries established reciprocal trade relationships in the aftermath of the conflict. In contrast, the number of disconnected dyads decreased dramatically from 118 in 2020 to 16 in 2022. This can potentially indicate a restructuring of trade networks in response to the geopolitical instability.\n\nLooking at the triad census, the '300' triads, indicating mutually connected triads, rose from 0 in 2020 to 15 in 2022. This implies an increase in fully interconnected trade relationships between groups of three countries, which could be a result of nations seeking more reliable trading partners or diversifying their trade networks to ensure supply chain resilience in light of the geopolitical turmoil.\n\n## Network Attributes\n\nIn analyzing wheat international trade during the Ukraine-Russia war, key network attributes can be calculated. These include degree, in-degree, and out-degree to measure trade connections, betweenness centrality to identify intermediary countries, eigenvector centrality to assess influence, and constraint centrality to evaluate vulnerability. These calculations provide valuable insights into the dynamics and impacts of the war on wheat trade networks and the countries involved.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnetworks <- list(network_2015, network_2016, network_2017, network_2018, network_2019, network_2020, network_2021, network_2022)\nnetwork_years <- c(2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022)\n\ndegree_centralities <- list()\ndegree_centralities_in <- list()\ndegree_centralities_out <- list()\nbetweenness_centralities <- list()\neigenvector_centralities <- list()\ncloseness_centralities <- list()\nconstraint_centralities <- list()\nin_weights <- list()\nout_weights <- list()\n\ndegree_df <- data.frame(\n  year = integer(),\n  country = character(),\n  degree_centralitie = numeric(),\n  degree_centralitie_in = numeric(),\n  degree_centralitie_out = numeric(),\n  betweenness_centralitie = numeric(),\n  eigenvector_centralitie = numeric(),\n  closeness_centralitie = numeric(),\n  constraint_centralitie = numeric(),\n  in_weight = numeric(),\n  out_weight = numeric(),\n  intensity = character(),\n  consol_intensity = character()\n)\ncommunity_memberships <- list()\n\nfor (i in seq_along(networks)) {\n  network <- networks[[i]]\n  year <- network_years[i]\n  \n  #

This indicates that the majority of nodes in the network have fewer connections.\n\nThe increase in density for nodes with a degree of 5 or less from 85 in 2021 and 76 in 2020 to 113 in 2022 implies a higher prevalence of nodes with very few connections in the network. This shift in the network structure could indicate the emergence of isolated or sparsely connected nodes.\n\nOne possible interpretation of these changes in the network is the impact of the Ukraine-Russia war and supply chain disruptions. The addition of new nodes with only a few connections or the removal of nodes with higher degrees could be a result of disruptions in the supply chain caused by the conflict. The dynamics of the war could have led to changes in trade relationships, with some countries reducing their interactions with Ukraine or seeking alternative trade partners.\n\nUkraine's degree has decreased from 92 in 2021 and 83 in 2020 to 44 in 2022. This decline in degree suggests that Ukraine has experienced a reduction in its connections or interactions with other nodes in the network. The Ukraine-Russia war and supply chain disruptions may have caused a disruption in Ukraine's trade relationships and resulted in a decrease in its degree within the network.\n\nIn 2022, the number of high-intensity trade countries with Ukraine decreased from 16 in 2021 to 9, while their degrees increased. The number and degree of low trading countries also decreased, while normal trading countries decreased in number but had a higher average degree. France was classified as a low trading country with Ukraine in 2021\n\nComparing 2021 to 2022, other countries in the network with high trade had higher degrees in 2021. However, in 2022, the number of high trading countries reduced, but their respective degrees increased. This suggests a shift towards more concentrated or extended trade relationships.\n\n**Average Degree Plot**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# List of networks\nnetworks <- list(network_2015, network_2016, network_2017, network_2018, network_2019, network_2020, network_2021, network_2022)\n\n# Create an empty list to store the average node degree for each year\naverage_degrees <- vector(\"double\", length(networks))\n\n# Loop over the networks\nfor (i in seq_along(networks)) {\n  network <- networks[[i]]\n  year <- 2015 + i - 1\n  \n  #

This highlights a strong trade partnership between the two countries in the wheat sector.\n\nThe United States, although importing a smaller quantity, obtained 0.98 million dollars' worth of wheat from Italy. While the volume may be relatively low, it demonstrates a trade link between the United States and Italy in terms of wheat imports.\n\nSouth Korea, another notable importer, sourced wheat from both Romania and Turkey. They imported 11.18 million dollars' worth of wheat from Romania and 3.76 million dollars' worth of wheat from Turkey. This showcases South Korea's diversified wheat imports from multiple countries.\n\nFrance, a prominent player in the wheat market, engaged in wheat imports from several European countries. They imported 11.05 million dollars' worth of wheat from Italy, indicating a trade connection between the two countries. Additionally, France imported 6.2 million dollars' worth of wheat from Romania and 6 million dollars' worth from Spain. These trade relationships highlight the interconnectedness between France and these European wheat-exporting countries.\n\nImportantly, these prominent countries appear to rely on intermediaries or trading partners that directly import from Ukraine. The observation is particularly significant for European countries that rank high in betweenness centrality, indicating their pivotal role in facilitating trade flows between Ukraine and other prominent wheat-importing nations.\n\nThe data from 2022 suggests that these prominent countries are involved in wheat imports from countries that have direct trade relationships with Ukraine. Additionally, European countries with high betweenness centrality values are serving as important intermediaries, importing from Ukraine and exporting to prominent wheat-importing nations globally.\n\n# Community Analysis\n\n## Community Detection\n\nTo perform community detection for the countries trading with Ukraine, the Walktrap community detection algorithm, cluster_walktrap, and the Fast Greedy Algorithm are suitable choices. These algorithms analyze the patterns of trade relationships to identify clusters or communities within the network. This analysis provides overall structure of the international wheat trade network in relation to the Ukraine-Russia war.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# List of networks\nnetworks <-

The graph shows that there are more prominent countries in community level and very less countries in lower rank community clusters. These prominent countries are associated with larger trade volumes, higher number of network degree values etc.\n\nThe presence of more countries in higher-ranked community clusters suggests the existence of dominant players in the wheat international trade network. These prominent countries likely have stronger trade connections, larger volumes of wheat trade, and potentially greater influence over global wheat markets. In the context of the Ukraine-Russia war, these influential countries may play a significant role in shaping the dynamics of the wheat supply chain and could have more leverage in dealing with the disruptions caused by the conflict.\n\nThe presence of higher-ranked community clusters with a larger number of countries suggests the existence of trade hubs or central nodes in the network. These trade hubs act as key intermediaries, connecting different regions or clusters within the wheat trade network. Analyzing the membership of countries in these higher-ranked clusters can help identify the countries that play a central role in the trade network. In the context of the Ukraine-Russia war, these trade hubs may face heightened risks and disruptions, impacting the overall flow of wheat trade.\n\nThe presence of multiple communities within the prominent cluster suggests that it is not a homogeneous group but rather consists of various subgroups with distinct characteristics. These subdivisions could represent different trade patterns, regional dependencies, or other factors that differentiate countries within the prominent cluster. Analyzing these communities can provide a deeper understanding of the internal dynamics and complexities within the cluster.\n\nThe lower number of countries in lower-ranked community clusters indicates that these clusters are relatively smaller and may have weaker trade connections or less influence in the network. In the context of the Ukraine-Russia war, countries belonging to these lower-ranked clusters might be more vulnerable to disruptions in the wheat supply chain. They may have limited alternative trade routes or dependencies on specific trading partners, making them more susceptible to the impacts of the conflict. By examining the composition of the clusters and the geographical distribution of countries within them, it may be possible to identify regions that are more strongly interconnected or regions with higher diversification in terms of trade partners. In the context of the Ukraine-Russia war, this information can help assess the regional impact of disruptions and identify potential alternative routes or partners to mitigate the effects of the conflict.\n\nThe community detection algorithm accurately identified all the prominent wheat trading countries, as United States of America, Australia, Canada, Indonesia, China, Japan have been identified in list of top countries through eigenvector centrality or betweenness centrality.\n\n## Community for High/Normal/Low Trade Countries\n\nPlots of High, Normal, Low Intensity Trade Countries using Walktrap Community\n\nThe yearwise bar plots distribution of communitities in each trade intensity category, with the trade intensity levels (high, normal, low) displayed on the x-axis and the corresponding count of countries on the y-axis.\n\nThis visualization provides a clear overview of the distribution of countries across different trade intensity categories within the community structure.

It categorizes these countries based on their trade intensity: high, normal, and low. The graph showcases the distribution of community membership rankings within each trade intensity category.\n\nAn important finding from the graph is that, regardless of the trade intensity category, there is a decreasing trend in the number of prominent countries according to their community ranking over time. This trend raises concerns about the diminishing prominence and influence of countries importing from Ukraine within their respective communities.\n\nThe decrease in the number of prominent countries within the communities of countries importing from Ukraine may indicate a temporary shift in trade patterns. European countries, which traditionally did not import directly from Ukraine, might have engaged in a stop-gap arrangement by importing from Ukraine and then exporting to prominent countries within the network. This diversification strategy helps mitigate the supply chain disruptions caused by the conflict, ensuring continued trade flows to the prominent countries.\n\nThe involvement of European countries as intermediaries reflects their adaptability and flexibility in managing the supply chain during the conflict. By importing from Ukraine and redirecting exports to prominent countries, these European countries play a significant role in maintaining stability within the wheat trade network. Their actions help ensure the continued availability of wheat to the prominent countries, mitigating potential disruptions caused by the conflict.\n\nThe temporary nature of the stop-gap arrangement highlights the resilience of the wheat supply chain in adapting to disruptions. However, it is essential to monitor the situation closely. Any prolonged or escalated conflict could still impact the overall stability of the supply chain and have broader economic implications. The reliance on alternative routes and intermediaries also introduces vulnerabilities, as any disruptions along these paths or changes in trade dynamics could still impact the flow of wheat to the prominent countries.\n\n# Hypothesis\n\n**Hypothesis 1**: The degree centrality of nodes in the wheat supply chain network is influenced by the Russia and Ukraine war, indicating the impact on the connectivity and structure of the supply chain.\n\nBy performing the CUG test on size using the degree centrality measure, this hypothesis aims to assess the impact of the Russia and Ukraine war on the wheat supply chain network. The degree centrality of nodes represents their level of connectivity and importance within the network. This hypothesis suggests that the war may disrupt or alter the connectivity and structure of the supply chain, leading to changes in the degree centrality of nodes involved in the wheat trade.\n\n**Hypothesis 2**: The number of edges in the wheat supply chain network, as measured by the degree centrality of nodes, is influenced by the Russia and Ukraine war, reflecting the changes in the flow of wheat trade and relationships among entities.\n\nBy performing the CUG test on edges using the degree centrality measure, this hypothesis examines the impact of the Russia and Ukraine war on the number of edges (connections) within the wheat supply chain network. The degree centrality of nodes represents their level of involvement in the trade relationships. This hypothesis suggests that the war may disrupt or alter the flow of wheat trade, leading to changes in the number of edges and the degree centrality of nodes involved in the supply chain.\n\n\n:::

observed values of the test statistic are quite similar, indicating a consistent degree centrality in the wheat supply chain network. Furthermore, the probabilities Pr(X\\>=Obs) and Pr(X\\<=Obs) are both 0, suggesting that the observed values deviate significantly from what would be expected under a uniform random graph model.\n\nBased on this analysis, it appears that the degree centrality of the wheat supply chain network did not show a significant change or impact in response to the Russia and Ukraine war across the years 2020, 2021, and 2022.\n\nThe shift in the density distribution of the degree distribution in 2022 compared to 2021 indicates potential changes in the connectivity and influence of nodes in the wheat trade network. The Russia and Ukraine war may have caused disruptions or alterations in the flow of wheat trade, resulting in shifts in the number of connections and the importance of nodes in the supply chain. Further analysis and investigation of the network structure can provide more insights into the specific changes and their implications on the wheat trade network.\n\n**Interpretation, Hypothesis 2**:\n\nIn all three years, the observed values of the test statistic are quite similar, indicating a consistent number of edges (degree centrality) in the wheat supply chain network. Furthermore, the probabilities Pr(X\\>=Obs) and Pr(X\\<=Obs) are both 0, suggesting that the observed values deviate significantly from what would be expected under a uniform random graph model.\n\nBased on this analysis, it appears that the number of edges in the wheat supply chain network, as measured by the degree centrality of nodes, did not show a significant change or impact in response to the Russia and Ukraine war across the years 2020, 2021, and 2022.\n\n**Hypothesis 3**: The betweenness centrality of nodes in the wheat trade network is influenced by the Russia and Ukraine war, reflecting the impact on the flow of trade and the importance of nodes as intermediaries in connecting different regions or entities.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# # List of

Hypothesis: The network correlation is equal to zero. One-Sample t-test Result: p-value = 0\n\nNetwork Correlation: The network correlation value represents the strength and direction of the correlation between the two networks. It indicates the similarity or dissimilarity in the network structure between 2021 and 2022. The specific correlation value will be provided in the output.\n\nThe p-value is less than the chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05), we can conclude that there is a significant difference in the network structure between 2021 and 2022, indicating changes in the relationships and connections within the wheat trade network over time.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe Ukraine and Russia conflict has triggered significant disruptions in the global supply chain, with specific implications for wheat production, grain exports, and energy supply. The reliance on these countries as major suppliers of wheat, as well as their involvement in other critical industries, has exposed vulnerabilities in various regions. As countries seek alternative sources, commodity prices rise, and inflation escalates, finding sustainable solutions and diversifying supply\n\nAfter analyzing the data, it was found that none of the countries under consideration imported significant quantities directly from Ukraine. To further investigate the trade relationships, a secondary analysis was conducted focusing on European countries with high betweenness centrality in 2022. The countries examined were Spain, Italy, Turkey, Poland, Greece, and Romania. These countries were identified as having a pivotal role in facilitating trade flows between Ukraine and other nations.\n\nThe purpose of this secondary analysis was to determine if any of the prominent countries under study imported wheat from these European countries. By exploring these potential trade links, it was aimed to uncover indirect connections between the prominent countries and Ukraine.The results of the analysis revealed that some of the prominent countries did import wheat from the aforementioned European countries. This suggests that while direct imports from Ukraine may be limited, there are intermediary trade relationships through these European countries. Such findings highlight the importance of considering indirect trade routes and intermediaries in understanding the overall trade dynamics between Ukraine and the prominent countries of interest. In 2022, the wheat trade dynamics revealed notable patterns in the import relationships between prominent countries and Ukraine.\n\nOne significant observation is that Egypt, a major wheat importer, imported a substantial amount of wheat worth 472.566 million dollars from Romania. This indicates a strong trade partnership between Egypt and Romania in the wheat sector.\n\nAnother interesting finding is that the United States, although importing a smaller quantity, obtained 0.98 million dollars' worth of wheat from Italy. This demonstrates a trade link between the United States and Italy in terms of wheat imports, despite the relatively low volume.\n\nSouth Korea, another notable importer, diversified its wheat imports by sourcing from both Romania and Turkey. They imported 11.18 million dollars' worth of wheat from Romania and 3.76 million dollars' worth of wheat from Turkey, showcasing their trade relationships with multiple countries.\n\nFrance, a prominent player in the wheat market, engaged in wheat imports from various European countries. They imported 11.05 million dollars' worth of wheat from Italy, highlighting a trade connection between France and Italy. Additionally, France imported 6.2 million dollars' worth of wheat from Romania and 6 million dollars' worth from Spain, indicating the interconnectedness between France and these European wheat-exporting countries.\n\nAn important observation is that these prominent countries rely on intermediaries or trading partners that directly import wheat from Ukraine. This is particularly significant for European countries that have high betweenness centrality values, indicating their pivotal role in facilitating trade flows between Ukraine and other prominent wheat-importing nations.\n\nBased on the 2022 data, it can be concluded that these prominent countries are involved in wheat imports from countries that have indirect trade relationships with Ukraine. Furthermore, European countries with high betweenness centrality values serve as important intermediaries, importing wheat from Ukraine and exporting it to other prominent wheat-importing nations worldwide.\n",
