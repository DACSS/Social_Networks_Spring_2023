Then you can read in the data, using base `read.csv` or `read_csv` standard tidy read command to read Comma Separated Values files or, alternatively, read the data in directly from loading a package.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nAdd any comments or documentation as needed. More challenging data sets may require additional code chunks and documentation.\n\n## Create a Network\n\nLoad the package `igraph` and create an `igraph` object (i.e. a graph or network) in the form of an edge list. The command may vary whether the data is given as a list of connections or an adjacency matrix. Is the network directed or undirected; weighted or unweighted; unimodal or bipartite? Can you plot it?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::",
