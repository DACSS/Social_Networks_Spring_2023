The edges are not weighted. The network is not bipartite, meaning that all nodes are of the same type, in this case, characters. Additionally, the network is directed, indicating that the marriage are mutual between the characters.\n\n\nThe analysis also shows that each node has a \"name\" attribute, which corresponds to the name of the character it represents. The names of all the characters are listed in the output. Additionally, each edge has \"Type\", \"Notes\",\"Generation\" attributes, which corresponds to the relationship between the characters connected by the edge. \n\nThis analysis provides useful insights into the relationships between the characters in the GoT Marriage Dataset. By studying the Edge Attribute Type, it is possible to identify the relationship status of the chcaracters. \n\nThe output shows that:\n\n-   The network got_like_dislike has 20 nodes and 255 edges.\n-   The network is not bipartite.\n-   The network is directed.\n-   The network doesn't have weighted edges.\n-   The only vertex attribute in the network is name, which gives the names of all the nodes.\n-   The names of all the nodes in the network are shown in the output.\n-   The edge attributes in the network \"Type\", \"Notes\",\"Generation\"\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r

Triad Analysis\n\nThe first analysis calculates the dyad census, which classifies all possible pairs of nodes in the network into three categories: mutual ties, asymmetric ties and null ties. In this case, there were 3 mutual ties and 57 null ties, and 130 asymmetric ties.\n\nThe triad census counts the number of each possible combination of three nodes in a network, which are called triads. The function returns a vector with 16 values, each corresponding to the count of a particular triad type. In this case, there are 408 triads of type 003, 227 triads of type 012, 217 triads of type 102, 110 triads of type 021D, 44 triads of type 021Um, 47 triads of 021C type etc.\n\nFinally, the code sums up the total number of triads returned by the triad census, which is 1140 This provides an overall picture of the patterns of relationships between nodes in the network.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Classify all Dyads in the got_like_dislike network: igraph\n\nigraph::dyad.census(got_marriages.ig)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n$mut\n[1] 3\n\n$asym\n[1] 57\n\n$null\n[1] 130\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Classify all Triads in the got_like_dislike Network: igraph\n\nigraph::triad_census(got_marriages.ig)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] 408 227 217 110  44  47   9  18  50   1   0   3   5   1   0   0\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Total number of Triads returned by triad census\n\nsum(igraph::triad_census(got_marriages.ig))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 1140\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Degree\n\nThe degree distribution of the \"got_marriages\" network, obtained from the GoT Marriage Dataset, provides insights into the connectivity of characters within the context of marriages.

It is the ratio of the actual number of connections to the maximum possible connections. It provides insight into how tightly connected the nodes are within the network structure. Density is a local measure, focusing on internal connections rather than external factors. In simple undirected networks, density is related to average degree, but this relationship may not hold for all network types. Considering the specific characteristics of the network being studied is crucial for understanding the relationship between density and average degree.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngraph.density(got_marriages.ig)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.6710526\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n## Random Network\n\nCreate a random (Erdos-Renyi) network with the same number of nodes and edges than the network of your choice.
